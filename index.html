    <h1>New York Fashion Week - September 2024</h1>
    <p>
      One of my favorite topics is fashion. I love following the different
      Fashion Weeks that take place worldwide. Its fascinating to me to see how
      each designer creates their collection and what influences their style.
      Luckily enough,
      <strong>New York Fashion Week (NYFW)</strong> 2024 just started today! The
      runways and events will be taking place from
      <strong>September 6th to the 11th</strong>. If you would like to know more
